# Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Tool

This tool can automate and simplify the modification of the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series. It's currently tested to work with all entries released (I through IV).

## Features:
  - Set the walking speed to Classic (60 px/second) or Fast (120 px/second). This can greatly reduce walking stutter as the original game's 80 px/second doesn't match the framerate of the game. 

## Planned Features
  - Modify Framerate
  - Modify AutoBattle speed
  - Your Suggestions!

## Usage
  - Download release from https://github.com/noskill-io/ffpr-tool/releases
  - Place ffpr-tool.exe in root game directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY PR\)
  - Run ffpr-tool.exe and follow the prompts
